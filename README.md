# todo-list
This is a To-do List created with React

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a basic Todo app created to start getting on the road of the React learning process, the excercise cover fundamentals such as components, passing properties from parents to childs, refactoring the code to look cleaner and to set up the envirnoment for the React Application</p>

<Instalatiom>

<li>Copy the code of the repository</li>
  <li>On your terminal locate the folder in which you would like to take the files and then press: <strong> git clone </strong> and then paste the code copied on the repository</li>
  <li>Once the files are cloned to the local file, in your terminal write <strong>code .</strong>. this will eventually open VSCode </li>
  <li>Work on the website and apply all the changes needed and when the progress is considerable write in the terminal <strong> git all .</strong> this will appply all the changes</li>
  <li>Write <strong> git commit -m (any text with the changes made) </strong> this will commit all the changes made so far</li>
  <li>Whenever the code is ready to upload it to the repository write <strong>git push origin master</strong>. If it is not the master repository then the code to write is <strong>git push origin main</strong> this is the location of the main branch.

<li>Along with the set up you may also want to add a "boiler plate" to the html code, which shoudl include:</li>
    <li>the babel transpiler</li>
        <ul><script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script></ul>
    <li>on the body section we must add the "root" div in order to conect the HTML file with our js react code</li>
        <ul>"<div id="root"></div>"</ul>
    <li>The React Libraries</li>
        <ul>"<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>"</ul>
        <ul>"<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>"</ul>
    
    <li>Finally all the JS pages that need to be liked to the main HTML, in this case:</li>
        <ul><script src="todo.js" defer type="text/babel"></script></ul>
        <ul><script src="form.js" defer type="text/babel"></script></ul>
        <ul><script src="index.js" defer type="text/babel"></script></ul>    

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>This project mainly works as Todo List that creates choirs and deletes them on the click event of each choir completed</p>
